`pipeworks_name_generation` is a standalone, GPL-3 licensed name generation system based on phonetic and syllabic recombination.

It generates **pronounceable, neutral names** intended to act purely as labels.  
Any narrative, cultural, or semantic meaning is deliberately left to downstream systems.

This project is designed to stand on its own and can be used independently of Pipeworks in games, simulations, world-building tools, or other generative systems.

## Design Goals

- Generate names that are **linguistically plausible**, not random strings
- Avoid direct copying of real names or source material
- Support **deterministic generation** via seeding
- Remain **context-free** and reusable across domains
- Keep runtime dependencies lightweight, predictable, and stable
- Allow different consumers to apply their own meaning and interpretation

---

## Non-Goals

This project deliberately does **not**:

- Encode lore, narrative meaning, or symbolism
- Distinguish between characters, places, organisations, or objects
- Imply cultural, regional, or historical identity
- Enforce genre-specific naming conventions
- Perform runtime natural-language processing
- Act as a world-building or storytelling system

All such concerns are expected to be handled by consuming applications.

## Architecture Overview

At a high level, the system works as follows:

1. Phonetic or syllabic units are derived from language corpora  
   *(analysis and build-time only)*
2. These units are stored as neutral, reusable data
3. Names are generated by recombining units using weighted rules and constraints
4. The system emits pronounceable name strings, without semantic awareness

Natural language toolkits (such as NLTK) may be used during **analysis or build phases**,  
but are intentionally excluded from the runtime generation path.

This keeps generation fast, deterministic, and easy to embed.

## Usage

`pipeworks_name_generation` is intended to be consumed programmatically.

Typical use cases include:

- Character name generation
- Place and location naming
- Organisation or faction names
- Artefact or object labels
- Procedural or generative world systems

The generator itself does not distinguish between these uses.

---

## Design Philosophy

Names generated by this system are **structural**, not narrative.

They are designed to feel:
- plausible
- consistent
- pronounceable

…but not authoritative.

Meaning, history, and interpretation are applied later, elsewhere.
